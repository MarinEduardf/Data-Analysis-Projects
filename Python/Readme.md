## Employee retention is a critical aspect for organizational success. 
### This repository contains an extensive analysis with the purpose of understanding the factors influencing employee decisions to stay or leave. By applying EDA techniques and machine learning models, we identify key features that contribute to employee retention.
**Project summary**
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves exploring the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying key variables. Python, particularly Jupyter Notebooks, is utilized for this stage.
### EDA Techniques:
- Descriptive Statistics
- Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Outlier Detection
- Correlation Analysis
### Visualizations
Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for creating insightful visualizations that aid in interpreting the data.
### Key Visualizations:
- Distribution Plots: Understanding the distribution of key variables.
- Scatter Plots: Exploring relationships between variables.
- Box Plots: Identifying outliers and understanding data dispersion.
- Heatmaps: Visualizing correlations between features.

### Machine Learning Models
#### The project involves the implementation of machine learning models to predict employee retention based on identified features.
- **Decision Tree Model**
- The Decision Tree model provides interpretability, revealing key decision factors influencing employee retention. It offers insights into the importance of factors such as the number of projects, last evaluation scores, job tenure, and the overworked indicator.
- **Random Forest Model**
- The Random Forest model enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging ensemble learning. It considers multiple decision trees, offering robust predictions and improving reliability. Feature importance analysis indicates that the number of projects, last evaluation scores, job tenure, and overworked indicator are key factors influencing employee retention.
