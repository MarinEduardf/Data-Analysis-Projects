## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Olympic data spanning from 1896 to 2016. The project explores various aspects of both Summer and Winter Olympic events, delving into athlete participation, medals performance, gender distribution, age-related trends, and correlations between different Olympic seasons.

**Project summary**
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves exploring the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying key variables. Python, particularly Jupyter Notebooks, is utilized for this stage.
### EDA Techniques:
- Descriptive Statistics
- Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
### SQL querying:
Used appropriate SQL queries in order to extract relevant data and use the results in different visualizations
### Visualizations
Matplotlib is employed for creating insightful visualizations that aid in interpreting the data.
### Key Visualizations:
- Distribution Plots: Understanding the distribution of key variables.
- Line charts: Understanding trends over certain periods of time
- Histograms: Visualize how the data is spread, based on key variables


## Implications
The findings provide insights into the evolving landscape of Olympic events, emphasizing the need for nuanced analyses considering factors such as gender, age, and historical trends.

## Limitations
Acknowledgment of missing data, particularly in the Age, Weight, and Height columns, which may influence the accuracy of certain analyses.

## Usage
- Explore the Jupyter Notebooks for detailed analyses.
- Use the provided SQL queries for database exploration.
- Contribute to further analysis and insights.

## Dependencies
- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib
- SQL Database (SQLite)

## Notes
- The athlete_events csv file had to be uploaded as an Excel workbook, due to exceeding file size.
- The project is available in pdf format and as a jupyter notebook containing the source code
