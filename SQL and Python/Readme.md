## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Olympic data spanning from 1896 to 2016. The project explores various aspects of both Summer and Winter Olympic events, delving into athlete participation, medals performance, gender distribution, age-related trends, and correlations between different Olympic seasons.

## Key Findings
1. **Athlete Participation:**
   - Conducted EDA to visualize the consistent upward trend in athlete count, indicating sustained growth in participation.

2. **Medals Performance:**
   - Utilized Matplotlib for visualizations, highlighting the increase in total medals won by athletes with noticeable upward trends in specific decades.

3. **Gender Distribution:**
   - Leveraged Matplotlib for visual representations, confirming more male athletes than females, with variations in gender distribution in both Summer and Winter events.

4. **Performance Trends:**
   - Utilized line charts and bar graphs with Matplotlib to illustrate the overall improvement in athlete performance in terms of medals won over the analyzed period.

5. **Age and Medal Count:**
   - Employed histograms using Matplotlib to visualize and confirm that athletes aged between 20 and 30 tend to receive the highest count of medals.

6. **Correlation between Summer and Winter Performance:**
   - Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients and visualized the results using Matplotlib.

7. **Standard Deviation in Performance:**
   - Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing standard deviation in Summer and Winter Olympic medal counts.

## Implications
The findings provide insights into the evolving landscape of Olympic events, emphasizing the need for nuanced analyses considering factors such as gender, age, and historical trends.

## Limitations
Acknowledgment of missing data, particularly in the Age, Weight, and Height columns, which may influence the accuracy of certain analyses.
