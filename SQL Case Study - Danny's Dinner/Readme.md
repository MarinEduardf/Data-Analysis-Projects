## This repository serves as a comprehensive solution resource for solving problems presented in a case study using PostgreSQL.
### Problem statement:
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

### This case study aims to improve an individual's SQL skills, by providing realistic problem statements which require complex SQL queries in order to extract relevant data from different tables, focusing mainly on the following:
1. **Common Table Expressions**
2. **Group By Aggregates**
3. **Window Functions for ranking**
4. **Table Joins**
